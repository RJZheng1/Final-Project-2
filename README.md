Pacapong

A combination of pong, pac-man and space invaders. You control a paddle that shoots a pac-man to the other side. 
You have some control over how the pac-man moves through the maze. Collect space invader icons to send space invaders on your opponentâ€™s side. 
Collect small circles to shoot them upwards. Avoid ghosts. Collect big orbs and consume ghosts. 
Do good things (get circles, eat ghosts, shoot space invaders) and get points. 
Do bad things (touch space invaders, let pac-man get through, touch ghosts, touch the barrels that donkey kong throws) and lose points. 
Have the most points at the end to win. Kinda complicated.

Road map of goals:
Pong:
1)	Players can control paddles with WASD and arrow keys (bounded within a certain area) Done
2)	Shoot a pac-man at the other side.
3)	Collide with pac-man and collect him.
4)	Timer and score bars at top.
5)	Music.
Pac-Man:
1)	Make the maze and allow pac-man to move through it. Pac-man controllable with same keys as paddles. Check walls, cannot go backwards (as in opposite of direction he faces, not toward your side).
2)	Ghosts that spawn (randomly?) and follow a specific path? Not sure what their AI entails. Colliding with them decreases score and gives pac-man to opponent.
3)	Small orbs get collected and increase score.
4)	Big orbs make ghosts blue and eat-able for a certain period of time. Eating them increases score.
5)	Space invaders icons. Spawn space invaders.
Space Invaders
1)	Space invaders spawn from top and move down. Lose points if you touch them.
2)	Small orbs also cause you to shoot them upwards (only shoots them if there are space invaders).
3)	Pac-man can collide with space invaders and destroy them, giving you points.
Donkey Kong:
1)	Donkey Kong (randomly?) shows up and throws barrels. Pac-man touching barrels gives pac-man to opponent. Paddle touching barrels decreases score.
